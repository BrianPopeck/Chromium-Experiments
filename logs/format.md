# Log Format Description

## Logs are output by g3log in the form:
LOG format: [YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss uuu* LEVEL FILE->FUNCTION:LINE] messagen
(uuu*: microseconds fractions of the seconds value)

## Example Output
A function entry would look like
```
2020/05/23 16:23:21 110646 INFO [experimenter.cc->experiment_fentry:146] 30936: UpdateStyleAndLayoutTree 11110000 2
    $1        $2      $3    $4             $5                             $6              $7                $8    $9
```
A function exit would look like

```
2020/05/23 16:23:21 168378 INFO [experimenter.cc->experiment_fexit:158] 30936: UpdateStyleAndLayoutTree 11111111    3   21.6936
    $1        $2      $3    $4                    $5                      $6               $7               $8      $9     $10
```

There is also a special log that includes PageLoadTime information that looks like this:

```
2020/05/23 16:23:21 168378 INFO [experimenter.cc->experiment_fexit:158] 30936: PageLoadTime 21.6936
    $1        $2      $3    $4                    $5                      $6       $7          $8
```

## Other files
Files are generally saved in a directory prefixed with `exp-` and then an 8 digit identifier. Any .log file containing the word `g3log` is unsurprisingly created by g3log and is the main framework output. Files prefixed with PyChrome- are generated by `chrome-experimenter.py` and just contain output from the Chromium binary, which will be a mixture of framework and Chromium output. The framework output in these files will, in most cases, simply be error or debugging messages and not usable data.
