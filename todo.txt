-------------
High Priority
-------------
- (experiment.cc) queues for timing nested functions
- (experiment.cc) function map
    - probably want to create this in experiment_init
    - use chrome-experimenter.py to generate hash for functions, sth faster than comparing strings
    - time IPC/affinity to see affect on performance
    - see ipc-file.txt
- (experiment.cc + chrome-experimenter.py) get IPC working between python + exp framework
    - create file structure: fentry mask, fexit mask, applicable functions
- (experiment.cc + chrome-experimenter.py) figure out why chrome crashes on twitter...
- (occupany.py + processing.py) get coz-like plots (big/little tradeoff) for each function

-------------
Med. Priority
-------------
- (summarize.sh) update for new experiment folder structure
- (occupany.py + processing.py) update for multiple iteration data (right now timestamps are not synced to iterations)
- (README.md) update docs

-------------
Low  Priority
-------------
- (chrome-experimenter.py) add flag for exp dir renaming
- (chrome-experimenter.py) add flag for headless rather than Xvfb (also compare the results)
- (chrome-experimenter.py) find a better (shorter) name
- (all files) clean up/comment for clarity
