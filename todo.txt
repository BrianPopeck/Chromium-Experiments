-------------
High Priority
-------------
- (occupany.py + processing.py) get coz-like plots (big/little tradeoff) for each function
    - (occupany.py + processing.py + chrome-experimenter.py) divy up data according to timestamps (i.e. between pageloads)

-------------
Med. Priority
-------------
- (occupany.py + processing.py) update for multiple iteration data (right now timestamps are not synced to iterations)
- (all files) Time the framework against -lNone to see if there's any noticable affect on page load time

-------------
Low  Priority
-------------
- (chrome-experimenter.py) add flag for headless rather than Xvfb (also compare the results)
- (experiment.cc + chrome-experimenter.py) figure out why chrome crashes on twitter...
- (chrome-experimenter.py) find a better (shorter) name
- (run-chrome.sh) - output to exp dir inside logs/ instead of directly to logs/
